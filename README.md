# AI Attendance System - Prototype Documentation

## Overview
This prototype demonstrates the integration of Steps 1, 2, and 3 of the AI Attendance System during the enrollment phase, followed by recognition testing.

## System Architecture Integration

### Step 1: Video Capture (Live Camera Feed)
- **Implementation**: `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` captures video at 30 FPS
- **Real-time Processing**: Each frame is immediately processed
- **Integration Point**: Feeds directly into Step 2 for face detection

### Step 2: Face Detection (Real-time Quality Control)
- **Algorithm**: Haar Cascade Classifier for fast detection
- **Quality Validation**: Multiple checks ensure good training data
  - Face size validation (minimum 50x50 pixels)
  - Position validation (face centered in frame)
  - Blur detection (Laplacian variance > 100)
  - Brightness validation (50-200 range)
  - Single face requirement (reject multiple faces)
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Green box = Good quality, ready to capture
  - Red box = Poor quality, needs adjustment
- **Integration Point**: Valid faces are passed to Step 3

### Step 3: Image Pre-processing (Real-time Enhancement)
- **Face Extraction**: Crop with 20% padding around detected face
- **Standardization**: Resize all faces to 128x128 pixels
- **Enhancement Pipeline**:
  1. Grayscale conversion
  2. Histogram equalization (improve contrast)
  3. Gaussian blur (reduce noise)
- **Data Storage**: Processed images saved with systematic naming
- **Integration Point**: Creates training dataset for recognition

## Key Integration Features

### 1. **Seamless Pipeline**
```
Live Video → Face Detection → Quality Check → Pre-processing → Storage
    ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓
  30 FPS      Real-time      Pass/Fail    Enhancement    Training Data
```

### 2. **Quality Control Loop**
- Only high-quality faces trigger image capture
- Automatic rejection of poor-quality frames
- User guidance for optimal positioning

### 3. **Guided Enrollment Process**
- **7 Different Poses**: Various angles and expressions
- **15 Images per Pose**: Comprehensive coverage
- **Total**: ~105 images per student
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate quality assessment

### 4. **Consistent Processing**
- Same pre-processing pipeline used in enrollment and recognition
- Ensures compatibility between training and testing phases
